Description: The SEQC/MAQC-III Consortium has produced benchmark
        RNA-seq data for the assessment of RNA sequencing technologies
        and data analysis methods (Nat Biotechnol, 2014). Billions of
        sequence reads have been generated from ten different
        sequencing sites. This package contains the summarized read
        count data for ~2000 sequencing libraries. It also includes all
        the exon-exon junctions discovered from the study. TaqMan
        RT-PCR data for ~1000 genes and ERCC spike-in sequence data are
        included in this package as well.
